Feature: Logging of unauthorized requests

Two new command line flags have been added in order to support logging of
unauthorized requests to the server. The flag `--log-auth-failure` enables
the logging and uses the remote address of the request as the default for
the logged ip. If the server is used behind a reverse proxy for, `--header-for-ip`
can be used to specify a header like "X-Forwarded-For" to be used for logging
the ip.
