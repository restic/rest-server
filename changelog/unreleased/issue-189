Enhancement: Support group accessible repositories

Rest-server now supports making repositories accessible to the filesystem group
by setting the `--group-accessible-repos` option. Note that permissions of
existing files are not modified. Use `chmod -R g+rwX /path/to/repo` to make
the repository group-accessible.
