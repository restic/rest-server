Enhancement: Prometheus metric for repository's last update

A new gauge metric `rest_server_repo_last_update_timestamp` was added to
monitor each repository's last write access. This allows a basic
monitoring for each repository's freshness.

This metric can be configured as an alerting rule. For example, to be
notified if some repository is older than two days:
> time() - rest_server_repo_last_update_timestamp >= 172800

In order to have this metric available at startup, a basic preloading for
Prometheus metrics has been implemented. This operates by scanning the file
system for restic repositories and using their last modified time.
Subsequently, each write access updates the last update time.

If scanning each repository takes too long, it can be disabled through the
`--prometheus-no-preload` flag.
