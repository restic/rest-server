Security: Prevent loading of usernames containing a slash

"/" is valid char in HTTP authorization headers, but is also used in
rest-server to map usernames to private repos.

This commit prevents loading maliciously composed usernames like
"/foo/config" by restricting the allowed characters to the unicode
character class, numbers, "-", "." and "@".

This prevents requests to other users files like:

curl -v  -X DELETE -u foo/config:attack  http://localhost:8000/foo/config
