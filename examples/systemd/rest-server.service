# As a whole, the purpose of these are to provide an additional layer of
# security by mitigating any unknown security vulnerabilities which may exist
# in rest-server or in the libraries, tools and operating system components
# which it relies upon.

# IMPORTANT!
# The following line must be customised to your individual requirements.
